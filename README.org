* Emacs Configuration

Some slides written in [[https://quarto.org][Quarto]] for showing how to setup [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] (I should probably have written them in [[https://orgmode.org][Org Mode]] but
haven't the time to suss out a quick way of rendering and uploading to GitHub Pages).
